<h2>Football</h2>
  <p>Two teams of eleven players each compete in the popular team sport of football, also known as football in some regions of the world. By kicking the ball into the goal post of the opposite team, players can score goals. Players manipulate and move the ball about the pitch using their feet, legs, torso and heads. The game is played on a rectangular field with goal posts at each end. The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is in charge of football, one of the most watched and played sports in the world, which has millions of spectators and participants worldwide.</p>
